A basic social interaction web for students to communicate with each other.
Plot twist: it is supposed to be a vulnerable php website, that`s where the ethical hacker in me comes out.
I tried to cover all the entry points that could allow security incidents suchs as xss, csrf, file_inclusion and sql_injection.
Be a hacker, defend the people! :))
